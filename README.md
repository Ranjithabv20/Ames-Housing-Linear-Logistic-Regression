# Ames-Housing-Linear-Logistic-Regression
This project focuses on predicting house prices and analyzing price categories using the Ames Housing dataset.
## Linear Regression

Built a regression model to predict SalePrice based on key housing features.
Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, and model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R².

## Logistic Regression

Converted house prices into categorical labels (e.g., High/Low price) and applied logistic regression for classification.
Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Tools & Techniques

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Train-Test Split
